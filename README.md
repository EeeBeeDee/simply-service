# Simply | Service

![Website homepage](documentation/desktop-img.png)

Simply Service is a hospitality app designed to be the one stop shop for restaurants and customers to combat the use of individual booking systems and websites of restaurants. This is my portfolio project 4 for Code Institutes full stack diploma.

# The Stratagy Plane

## Agile Planning

This project has been approached with an Agile mindset. Using epics, tasks and user stories. I have laid out not only what I plan to achieve with this website but what I expect users hitting the home page will want. This approach has helped to compartmentalize development and make what I hope to achieve much more manageable. 

This can be seen implemented on my projects [Kanban.](https://github.com/users/EeeBeeDee/projects/3/views/1)

## Epics and Tasks

The First 6 Epics are essential and the minimum needed to deliver the basic application so their tasks were prioritized with any following epics designated as extras with descending priority.

### **Epic 1: Project Initialization & Deployment**

This includes the initial project setup, installing the framework, dependencies and libraries. Setting up ElephantSQL. Configuring our settings.py file and Heroku Application so that everything is connected and running on the live site as early as possible.

---

### **Epic 2: Databases & Migration**

This includes the model setup for the booking system and general connection to the DB.  Any extra apps will have their model set up included with them. 

---

### **Epic 3: Bookings**

With the model already set up this included the booking form creation and views creation, making sure post and get requests worked as intended and information was retrieved in a parsable way.

---

### **Epic 4: Front End Design**

With the back end functionality in place this epic included all design and front end functionality. Making information easily accessible.

---

### **Epic 5: Responsiveness** 

As Bootstrap was used fairly extensively, not many media queries were needed to facilitate a responsive design and this epic ended up being a lot smaller than I had imagined when planning the site.

### **Epic 6: Documentation and Testing**

## **Non Essential Epics**

### **Epic 7: User Accounts**

### **Epic 8: Restaurant Creation**

### **Epic 9: Unique Error Pages**


## **Unresolved Epics**
