# The Stratagy Plane

## Agile Planning

This project has been approached with an Agile mindset. Using epics and user stories I have laid out not only what I plan to achieve with this website but what I expect users hitting the home page will want. This approach has helped to compartmentalize development and make what I hope to achieve much more manageable. 

This can be seen implemented on my projects [Kanban.](https://github.com/users/EeeBeeDee/projects/3/views/1)

## Epics and Tasks

The First 6 Epics are essential and the minimum needed to deliver the basic application so their tasks were prioritized with any following epics designated as extras with descending priority.

### **Epic 1: Project Initialization & Deployment**

This includes the initial project setup, installing the framework, dependencies and libraries. Setting up ElephantSQL. Configuring our settings.py file and Heroku Application so that everything is connected and running on the live site as early as possible.

The inital app of homepage was created also.
